My Interactive Media Website
Hi everyone,

If you are reading this then hello, you have found the code for my website. This was completed as part of a University project for Interactive media.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

Between the 26th of May and the day the marks are released (2-3 weeks from now) there will be no changes as to not effect the assessment. If there are any changes, they will be outlined in the commitments (much like this update).

If you have found any bugs or issues or want something changed, please add them to the issues tab on this repository. It's especially helpful if you are using different browsers or different screen sizes.
Thanks again!
