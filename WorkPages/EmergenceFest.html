        <p>During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the creative arts industry was severely impacted due to lockdowns and restrictions Young artists from all around Melbourne were the hardest hit and once we return to COVID Normal, there needs to be a place for artists can get direct support from their audience.</p>
        <p>The perfect way to bring back an audience is through something that most of us have missed for the past year, a festival. So, introducting Emergence Fest by PlusArts</p>
        <br>
        <p>This project was part of a university assignment called 'Future Hope' for Studio 1 - Reset in which we had to design something that would bring hope back into a community effected by the pandemic. As a creative myself, this is extremely important.</p>

        <p>For the posters, I wanted to put emphasis on the artist. Making them front and center of the poster. I also wanted to spread messages about supporting creatives such as 'create the creatives' or 'fund the future'.</p>

        <p>For the rest of the material, I kept the same colour pallete and imagery so that everything would be linked.</p>

        <p>The goal of the project was to create a connection between the artist and their audience. Below is a card with a unique PlusCode that can be scanned through the PlusArts app to learn more about the artist and see how you can support their journey.</p>
